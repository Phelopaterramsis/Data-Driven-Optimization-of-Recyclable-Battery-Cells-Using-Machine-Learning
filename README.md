# Data-Driven-Optimization-of-Recyclable-Battery-Cells-Using-Machine-Learning
This folder contains my first research paper, where we designed a custom battery-tester circuit and built machine-learning models to estimate **State of Charge (SoC)**, **State of Health (SoH)**, and **Remaining Useful Life (RUL)** for recyclable battery cells used in electrified systems.
